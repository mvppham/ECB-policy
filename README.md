# ECB-policy
After the global crisis in 2008, central banks across the world faced the problem of reaching the zero lower bound with their policy interest rate. As this measure lost its power and economies were still stagnating, central banks were forced to conduct unconventional measures to provide further help. In this analysis, we want to compare the effects of the ECB's conventional and unconventional monetary policy on the euro area.
